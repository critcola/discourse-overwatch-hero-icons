# Overwatch Hero Icons for Discourse

This plugin for Discourse formats Overwatch hero names in posts. It tries to intelligently match hero names in users' posts, including those that are horribly misspelled, correcting their spelling, adding accent marks and other special characters where necessary, and prepending the hero's icon to their name.

## Demo

See it in action and test it out for yourself on [Crit Cola's Discourse](https://critcola.com/community/t/new-overwatch-hero-emoji-icons/153?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=demo&utm_content=overwatch-hero-icons&utm_campaign=development).

## Installation

Add the plugin's repository URL to your container's `app.yml` file, for example:

```yml
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - mkdir -p plugins
          - git clone https://github.com/critcola/discourse-overwatch-hero-icons.git
```

Rebuild the container:

```sh
cd /var/discourse
./launcher rebuild app
```

For the plugin to apply retroactively, you'll need to rebake old posts:

```sh
cd /var/discourse
./launcher enter app
rake posts:rebake
```
